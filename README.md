# ElasticHealth Go Microservice

Microservice written in Go to retrieve and deliver the health, status and the indices of an Elasticsearch cluster using gRPC endpoints.

# The project

The project is a microservice written in Golang exposing gRPC endpoints. Those endpoints allow a client program to retrieve informations about an Elasticsearch cluster like health, status and its indices. The global implementation is wrapped around a Docker container. The docker image can be found in Docker hub here : https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kevinplltr/elastic-health. Additionally, the project can be used in a Kubernetes/Openshift environment, as it provides a usable Helm chart running this docker image. 

The microservice is launched by passing the elasticsearch cluster hostname:port parameter. There is a one-to-one relationship between the microservice and an elasticsearch cluster. In order to use the microservice on another elasticsearch cluster you need to execute a 2nd instance of the elastichealth microservice.

# Features

Currently, the microservice allows a client to call his gRPC endpoints and offers the following functionalities : 

- Get the elasticsearch cluster health/status, name and the number of nodes running.
- Get the list of indices associated with this elasticsearch cluster.
- Get the health, status and uuid of an indice of the cluster. (Given the index name)
- Create a new index in the elasticsearch cluster
- Delete an index in the elasticsearch cluster

# How to run
In folder elastic_health there is the executable for the microservice

## gRPC Client executable written in Go
grpc_client folder
- client.go
`./client <grpc hostname> clusterhealth`
`./client <grpc hostname> listindices`
`./client <grpc hostname> indexhealth <index name>`
`./client <grpc hostname> createindex <index name>`
`./client <grpc hostname> deleteindex <index name>`

## Helm chart
helm-chart-elastic folder
In values.yaml we can see that we are using one image which is the one stored in dockerhub `kevinplltr/elastic-health` and that we specify the gRPC port which is 9000.
